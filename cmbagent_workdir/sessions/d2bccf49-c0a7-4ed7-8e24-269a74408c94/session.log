**PLAN**

- Step 1:
	* sub-task: Generate and plot a 3D Möbius strip using matplotlib
	* agent in charge: engineer

	* instructions:
		- Write Python code to parametrize the Möbius strip in 3D.
		- Use numpy to generate the coordinates for the strip.
		- Use matplotlib's 3D plotting capabilities to visualize the Möbius strip.
		- Display the resulting 3D plot.

[2026-02-18 10:00:27.076] [agent.message] plan_reviewer: Recommendations:
- Since the plan is currently a single step, consider splitting it into two distinct steps to separate the tasks of computing the Möbius strip's coordinates and plotting them. For instance, Step 1 could focus on parameterizing and computing the coordinates using numpy, while Step 2 could handle creating the 3D plot and customizing display features.
- In the current instructions, include recommendations for the engineer to add axis labels, a title, and perhaps adjust the viewing angle to enhance visualization clarity.
- Suggest that the engineer add inline comments and documentation within the Python code to improve readability and maintenance.
- Recommend verifying that the generated parameters cover the full surface of the Möbius strip to ensure a complete and accurate plot.
- Advise testing the code snippet in environments where matplotlib and numpy are installed to confirm proper execution and display of the 3D plot.

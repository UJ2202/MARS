["Idea 1: Linear Regression Model for Market Impact\n     * Use linear regression to model the relationship between market impact (e.g., price change) and explanatory variables derived from order flow and volatility.\n     * Features: signed order flow (net buy/sell volume), order flow imbalance, realized volatility, trade size, time of day.\n     * Simple to implement and interpret; provides a baseline for more complex models.", "Idea 2: Nonlinear (Power Law) Market Impact Model\n     * Model market impact as a nonlinear function of order flow, e.g., using a power law: Impact = k * (Order Size)^\u03b1, with \u03b1 < 1.\n     * Incorporate volatility as a scaling factor or additional regressor.\n     * Estimate parameters using nonlinear least squares or maximum likelihood.", "Idea 3: Machine Learning Model (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)\n     * Use tree-based models to capture nonlinear and interaction effects between order flow, volatility, and market impact.\n     * Features: order flow statistics (imbalance, aggressiveness), volatility measures (realized, implied), market depth, recent price moves, time features.\n     * Can handle complex relationships and feature interactions; requires careful validation to avoid overfitting.", "Idea 4: Econometric Time Series Model (e.g., VAR, GARCH-X)\n     * Use a Vector Autoregression (VAR) or GARCH-X model to jointly model price changes, order flow, and volatility over time.\n     * Features: lagged order flow, lagged volatility, lagged returns, exogenous variables (e.g., market events).\n     * Captures dynamic feedback between order flow, volatility, and market impact.", "Idea 5: Impact Surface Estimation\n     * Estimate a two-dimensional \u201cimpact surface\u201d where market impact is a function of both order flow and volatility (e.g., via kernel regression or local polynomial regression).\n     * Visualize and analyze how impact varies across different regimes of order flow and volatility.\n     * Useful for exploratory analysis and for informing parametric model choices.", "Idea 6: Regime-Switching Model\n     * Model market impact as a function of order flow and volatility, but allow parameters to switch depending on market regime (e.g., high vs. low volatility).\n     * Use hidden Markov models or threshold models to identify regimes.\n     * Captures structural changes in market impact dynamics."]

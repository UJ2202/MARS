By incorporating demand elasticity analysis and advanced econometric techniques, the study seeks to uncover subtle pricing dynamics that can significantly enhance revenue generation. The project will explore the integration of external factors and customer segmentation to simulate real-world scenarios, ensuring the robustness of the proposed models. A step-by-step plan will be developed to test underlying assumptions and align model parameters with observed data behavior. The findings are expected to provide actionable insights for dynamic pricing strategies, ultimately benefiting event organizers and consumers alike.",

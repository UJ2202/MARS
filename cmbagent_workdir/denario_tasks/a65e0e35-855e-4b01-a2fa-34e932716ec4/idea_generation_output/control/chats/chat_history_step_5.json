The enhancements made, such as incorporating event-specific features and temporal cyclic factors, make the forecasting model more robust. Additionally, the focus on multi-model comparisons and clear evaluation metrics ensures a thorough analysis. While attention must be given to computational feasibility and feature engineering, the potential impact and applicability of this research make it the most promising choice.",
